## What is Data?

- Definition: Data is a collection of facts or information that can be processed by a computer. It can represent numbers, text, images, or sounds.

## Data types in JS :

A. Primitive Data-Types :
These are the basic data types provided by a programming language. They are predefined by the language and built into its syntax. Primitive data types are not composed of other data types and are stored directly in memory. They represent simple values and have a fixed size. Examples include numbers, strings, booleans, and symbols (if supported by the language). Primitive data types are typically immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after they are created.

1. null
2. undefined
3. boolean (true or false)
4. number (1,2,3,NaN,5.5,-1.5,-5 etc)
5. string ("Pramod")
6. bigInt
7. symbol (unique)

B. Non-Primitive Data-Types :
Also known as composite or reference data types, these are more complex data structures that are composed of multiple primitive or non-primitive data types. Non-primitive data types do not store their values directly in memory; instead, they store references (or pointers) to memory locations where their values are stored. Examples include arrays, objects, functions, and classes. Non-primitive data types are often mutable, meaning their values can be modified after they are created. They provide greater flexibility for handling complex data structures and behaviors compared to primitive data types.

1. Array
2. Function
3. Map
4. Set
5. Object
