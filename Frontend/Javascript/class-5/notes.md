## What are Loops?

- In programming, loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. They allow you to avoid repeating code and provide a way to perform repeated tasks efficiently.

## Why Loops?

- Real-life analogy: You are doing a repetitive task, like counting from 1 to 100 manually. Wouldn't it be better to tell the computer to do this for you?
